* Boundary handling in PCISPH.
  In [[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fbc1/b9c2a3438c79a1ef8684bc87ac5e2149643e.pdf][BHATP]] boundaries are represented using non moving fluid particles, which
  has the following properties
  - mass(m_b), density(\rho_b), pressure (p_b)
  - More importantly **normalized normal (n_b)**.
  - The spacing between boundary particles is



* Doubts

*** Boundary particle spacing.
    Boundary particle spacing is equal to the equilibrium distance of
    fluid particles.
