* These are the observations while performing PCISPH elliptical drop simulations.


* Algorithm for a single fluid simulation

** Algorithm

*** While animating
   - Before starting a simulation do  compute density of each particle
     and say  rho(t).  Now save  this density  value in rho0,  so that
     comparison could be  done to scale pressure value  at a predicted
     position.
   - Save properties of particles at time t.
   - Compute delta value at time t.

*** While iterating:
   - Predict the positions at t+dt.
   - Compute density at t+dt using summation density.
   - Find deviation using rho0 i.e., density at time t. As rho will
     be density at t+dt in pysph.
   - Update pressure.
   - Now bring the particle properties back i.e, x, y, z, rho which
     were at t+dt, should be initialised to the saved props including
     density.
   - These properties brought back to because the pressure force is dependent
     on properties at time t not at time t+dt.
   - Now compute pressure force.
   - Now again predict and correct until convergence is achieved.


*** Note:
   - Compute delta correctly, and see if that could get good results.


*** Doubts:
    - Why does rho0 and rho are equal?
      1. If summation density is not applied before starting
         simulation then both will be equal, and there could be any
         difference while iterating which results in incorrect results.
         - I was using XSPH formulation
      2. Even applying summation density both density arrays are
         having same values with zero varying density, but there is a
         good amount of pressure while iteration. (How is this
         possible?)
         - I was using XSPH formulation
      3. Actually in 1. we should have so much density change and it
         should result in too much pressure. (reasons are
         trivial). But it shows up zero pressure.
         - I was using XSPH formulation

** After many iterations

   After many simulations I am able to get something for elliptical
   drop using PCISPH.
   - For a time step of 1e-5, and computing momentum equation at x_t,
     y_t and rho_t, with varying delta values.


** DONE Try a simulation with a dt of 1e-3 correct delta values.
   CLOSED: [2017-07-31 Mon 10:22]
   Check if you need any alpha or beta values in momentum equation.
   - Default values will be okay.
   Check why you have a constant density every where.
   - Solved. I was using XSPH formulation.

** TODO Implement Leap frog or RK2 method while iterating.


** Elliptical drop running simulation
   - **Note** Results before converge method implementation

   Elliptical drop behaves relatively different.
   - While simulating elliptical drop, the following parameters are to be
     changed to get a working output.
   - Make max iterations=5.
   - **Important** The delta value should be different and max should
     not be used.

** Two blocks running simulation
   - **Note** Results before converge method implementation

   Two blocks works as per pcisph algorithm.
   - The following parameters are required while simulating TwoBlocks.
   - Make max iterations=5.
   - Take maximum delta for pressure update.

   - tf = 1 sec
     - While tf=1sec the simulation blows up at tf=0.9. Because
       The particles are diverging and the density of every particle is
       not converged. Because of which the density difference is high
       so the pressure has high values while updating.
