* Abstract
  In this paper fluid flowing through a porous deformable material is
  simulated. Law of Darcy takes care of coupling fluid with fluid
  medium. This is an overcome to low time step of previous
  implementations. This predicts the deformation of wet objects under
  fluid.

* Introduction
  Fluid-rigid [[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi%3D10.1.1.3.8713&rep%3Drep1&type%3Dpdf][Carlson et al 2004]] and fluid-deformable [[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1073299][GUENDELMAN et al. 2005]],
  animations have been done, but mainly considering that the fluid is
  not penetrable in to the body.

  In the present work SPH is used to simulate fluid-observant objects
  and their changing behaviour. The present work is an extension to
  of [[http://matthias-mueller-fischer.ch/publications/sca03.pdf][Muller et al. 2003]],  [[https://graphics.ethz.ch/~sobarbar/papers/Sol05/Sol05.pdf][Muller et al. 2005]],  [[https://graphics.ethz.ch/~sobarbar/papers/Sol07b/Sol07b.pdf][B. Solenthaler 2007]],
  [[https://cg.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publications/2007_SCA_SPH.pdf][Markus becker 2007]], by using these concepts wetting of objects can be
  simulated.

  Previous formulations are computationally very expensive and the
  present method will use very less particles to capture the physics
  and reflexes the same physics as the previous method.

   Since this paper deals with SPH in rigid porous simulation, author
   cited few good SPH papers in fluid field.
   - As a first paper Monaghan 2005 for a reference.

   In graphics community SPH was first introduces by Desbrun and Gauscel 1996
   to simulate highly deformable object. After them Muller 2003, Muller 2005
   took it forward.
