    Citing is easy.
**** Using doi
     - Say you have a DOI of a paper.
     - do M-x doi-add-bibtex-entry
     - It will automatically add the paper. And will download if it is allowed.

**** Using cross ref
     - Say we have a title or author or journal of a paper.
     - Then do, M-x cross-ref-add-bibtex-entry
     - Paste the title or what ever.
     - org-ref will search for our paper and gives few suggestions.
     - Enter on requisite paper.
     - If you want more then mark all those papers and enter. C-spc.

    Notes creation from bib file.

**** from bib file
     Once the bib file is created. We can do
     - do M-x org-ref-open-bibtex-notes.
     - It will create a heading named after your file. With citing
       your bib. And other contents.
     - Since it is citing your file. Org-ref has awesome functions for
       clickable citations.
     - you can go to the link of the citation. Or you can download the pdf
       from web and many more.
     - Say, while entering the bib using crossref or doi, our system
       didn't download the pdf.
     - Since in clickable link we have a download option it will download
       it if available.
     - If our institute is not allowing so. Then we can manually
       download the pdf.
     - And don't forget to save it in your default papers storage directory.
     - And save it as the name as it was cited.
